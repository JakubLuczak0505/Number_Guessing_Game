<h1>Number Guessing</h1>

<h2>Info</h2>
The game consists of simple Python code. When we launch the game, we are greeted by a message informing us that the game has selected a number between 1 and 100. At this point, the game allows us to guess this number by entering numbers. If we enter a number that is much smaller than the number selected by the game, we will receive a message that the selected number is incorrect, and we must guess higher. However, if we enter a number that is too large, the game will again tell us that the selected number is incorrect, only this time we must guess lower. And if we guess correctly, the game will congratulate us and also inform us how many times we guessed.
